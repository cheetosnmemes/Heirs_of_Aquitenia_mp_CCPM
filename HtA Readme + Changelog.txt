The Heirs to Aquitania
A total conversion mod by Savs
Based on the HtA megacampaign

Features a new world with nearly 800 years of different history (mostly as determined by the computer in CK2 and EU3)
Development has been in fits and spurts since June 2014. The mod is based on /gsg/Vickymod v1.06, which was popular at that time.
If you want to contact me, find me on reddit as /u/Savolainen5 or on the Paradox forums as Savolainen5
Also check out reddit.com/r/savs, where history and other stuff are posted. However, please direct discussion about the mod to the thread as much as possible, in keeping with Paradox rules.
Forum thread for the mod: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/
There's an event numbers list at the bottom of this file

Feel free to use anything from this mod without asking me. Please do attribute it, though.

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**
- If you downloaded a .rar (from the official forum, for example): Extract the .mod and the folder to Programfiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
- If you downloaded HtA from Github: Put the folder this file is in in your game files' mod folder. Take the .mod file (it might look like a movie file of some kind for you) out and have it also be in the mod file next to the Heirs to Aquitania folder.
If you're using Steam, the target directory is gonna be Programfiles(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod. So, to be clear, in the end you'll have an Heirs to Aquitania folder and an Heirs to Aquitania .mod
file both in your Vic2 mod folder with the aforementioned path. If the main HtA folder is called The-Heirs-to-Aquitania-Master, rename it to The Heirs to Aquitania.

**CHANGELOG**

Version 0.36 X/Y/19 - The Russias & China Update

*Major*

- Story and flavour for Russia and Smolensk
- Events and decisions for China by /u/chortlinggnome, see changelog below
- Incorporated HPM's crisis locking system and election event spam reduction system
- HtA story chain regarding Corsica involving Aquitania, PDN, and Naples/Italy
- Blobby decision added to get cores on most of the European Western Mediterranean as a Romance country
- Added a de-escalation event after the Eyjafjallajokul eruption and subsequent famine which SHOULD cut down on the number of rebels. But expect to see many countries of Europe fall to them still. That's more or less what I want
- Added lots more soldier and craftsman POPs to normal GPs, did some industrial boosting

*Minor*

- Some Luxembourg buffing
	- Added Wallonian to accepted cultures of Luxembourg
	- Added a fun cheese decision for a GP Luxembourg to get cores on all of France, Wallonia, and Germany (and it will get Central German as an accepted culture)
	- Added a second fun cheese decision to follow to get cores on Netherlands and accept Dutch. You must hold some French cores and some German cores in order to take the decision
- Localisation file consolidation
- Added some relationships from the EU3 save
- Updated some diplomacy
- Gave some Persian provinces to Azerbaijan to better reflect the state of the world
- Forum user Discux made tons of new party names for the Amerigas, added them. Thanks!

- UBD no longer has Estonian as a primary
- Updated a bunch of flags, with special thanks to Athemos
- Halved POP growth bonus for Steenkooler republics
- Halved MIL and CON gain during famine from volcano
- Expanded Margaria's expansion events to include more commonly-empty provinces
- Added a decision for Margaria/Ginnaecer (or conceivably some other country) to expand into Oai (typically the last state to be colonised in NA)
- Added an event for any NA country which has borders on a coreless empty province to get a random event to own that province. SAVS THINKS THIS SHOULD BE MADE TO BE A REAL cOLONY PROVINcE, NOT A STATE
- Added a decision to annex Silesia after it has been puppeted by the Secure Silesia decision
- Added decisions to colonise the oft-empty states of Newea and Necen in NA
- Forming Bohemia-Hungary now removes Bohemia cores
- Tweaked/added decisions for Naples/Italy to better deal with Tuscany and getting cores on the Padan Union, thanks to Spudgun
- Tweak/fix for decision for forming SGF so that it works
- Tweaked the population growth maluses for Disaster Damage and Fire Recovery event modifiers
- Added an event for France to get cores on Brittany if it doesn't have them and to change the province names to the French ones
- Added an event for the Celtic Federation (CLT) owning Brittany to revert names from possible French names to Breton ones
- Added a number of flavour events
- Changed the name of Romania to Volasea (as a sort of quasi-plausible development of Volcae/Vlach/Wallach into something that isn't Romania, because, you know, Romans exist)
	- The new tag is VOL, though I haven't changed other things, like party name codes, regions, or the culture code
- Tweaked the colour of Central German culture to be more distinguishable from North German
- Modified the Cherokee country colour
- Italian (that is, south_italian) added as an accepted culture to Sicily
- Treaty of Szekes gives signatories cores on the provices they get from Bohemia, Bohemia keeps its cores in Moravia and isn't releasable
- PDN can get cores on VEN even if someone snipes Venice first, like Crushric likes to do when playing as BAV
- Greece now will declare war on the Roman Empire in the Roman Civil War as soon as war with Anatolia begins, rather than waiting for 20 military score
- Incorporated decision for Norway to claim some Caribbean islands, courtesy of /u/Flapjack731. Thanks!
- Renamed and adjusted some provinces in Russia
- Added old world island terrain type from HPM - New world islands need to be added
- Made Don Cossacks exist from game start as Smolensk puppet for inclusion in Russia stuff
- Improved some OOBs, added some missing ones
- Adjusted POPs in a number of places with the above in mind
- Added some Sephardic POPs to Aquitania and Ashkenazi to SOME of France. Needs more - ALWAYS
- Transcaucasia formation decisions are only available when Railroading is off
- Armenia will move its capital to Erivan when it loses Yerzenka
- Made lots of vassals at game start into substates so that the Acquire Substate State cb can be used against their overlords
- Tweaked POP migration a bit, taking inspiration from HPM
- Added a flag for New World countries which helps with the above (and an event to assign it if it's not there from the beginning)
- Gave Hispania the port of Penang on the Malay Peninsula
- Gave a number of countries different ideals
- The Oheskewen canal now has stricter requirements for construction - you must either own the province yourself, or your vassal must
- Lots more tweaks

*Bugfixes*

- Zachadia can no longer form Poland
- Tweaked Zachadia formation to work better, no longer relies on the enacter only holding its own cores
- For real fixed the Brunswick Congress Chain. All this time I've been missing the fact that there was a global flag which was missing an underscore and so it wasn't matching with an event trigger
- Evangelos Melisurgos dies properly now. Credit to /u/PaumCharmoso for pointing it out
- Fixed the form SGF decision to actually work. Thanks to /u/Hirotsugu for pointing it out
- Russian steppe event no longer spams when annexing Smolensk
- Hispania's OOB works
- Fixed and greatly improved the German Hegemony CB

*China/Japan content changelog by /u/chortlinggnome:*
- added event chain for civil war between Qin and Nanyue, pulling in Qin vassals, Mongolia and Manchuria
- added option for Qin to reform government and potentially avoid Warlord period; can be done manually or via political reforms
- SE Asia destiny decision for GXI; cores on Luang Prubang, Cambodia, Champa, Lan Xang, Middag. Dem clean borders doe
- changed Xinhai Rev trigger to avoid reformed QIN, unless reformed QIN loses monarchy.
- added new flags for QIN_monarchy and QIN_republic
- New flags + govt type localisation for GXI 
- Changed localisation for reformed Qin, reformed Qin now uses QIN_republic flag
- Accept Nanfaren decision for reformed QIN 
++ my thought process is that Warlordism should be avoidable with a strong, stable monarchy
++ however, true democracy taking hold will be chaotic just as IOTL
++ reforming QIN will be a challenge - race against time to research or unlock political reforms while MIL builds
++ This all needs playtesting!
- changed Unequal Treaty Decision to apply to non-GPs, removed eligibility for Southeast Asian nations when fighting GXI. This should stop SPs from annexing states
- Removed Portuguese Macao; now goes to random GP early in game as part of Nanyue trade/westernisation agreement
- Changed China decisions to apply Taiping total war conditions for GXI, YNN and MGL
- China Taiping events folder applied to GXI, QIN
- Korean war event / decision chain between China and Japan
- Japan expansion in Ainu Mosir and Taiwan
- Removed Chinese cores from North Jiangxi - 1545, 1546, 1549, 1551. Regainable during Qin Civil War
