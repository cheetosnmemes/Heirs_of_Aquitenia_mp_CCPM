## Hispania Dev Diary :

Welcome to the Hispania Dev Diary. Today I will be showing you the changes made to Hispania in order to make them not an automatic superpower and give them something to do other than conquering all of India and bullying other nations.

Here is the map of Iberia. As you can see, Hispania is no longer a nation that starts out formed. Hispania is a formable for all Iberian nations except Navarra. Each nation has their own special form of Hispania where they may get different accepted cultures such as Catalonia. Now, for some extra spice, Andalusia has the option to form the Umayyad Caliphate.

The Umayyads have the ability to get Maghrebi and Berber accepted as well as Spanish and Galician. Also, Catalonia, if unable to form Hispania, has the ability to form Aragon and get accepted cultures and cores on Sardinia and Corsica. All Bengal provinces owned by Hispania in India have been given back to Bengal and Bengal has been released from puppet status to free. I feel like this balances out the civil war being fought in Iberia as Castile can't get Indian troops to tip the scales in Iberia.
