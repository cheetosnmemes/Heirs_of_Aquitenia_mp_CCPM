To Do, v0.36

Events:

- Springtime of Nations should hit Roman Empire harder?
- French popular radicalism in Paris that begins uniting. Not really necessary now that France is buffed. Pan-Nationalists are strong, too
- Event/Decision to try to mediate Germany?
- Revisit that ability of German states to not attend the Brunswick congress - AI will currently always attend
- Tweak Bavarian choices for Brunswick Congress so they're better
- Saxony making problems for Brandenburg when it attends the Brunswick congress and is still a BOH ally.
- Danubian Federation-thing for Roman Empire
- Massive problem for the Roman Empire if they fail to take Rome, or if they lose it.
- Small event chain to change Wallonia into some other country which accepts Picard (or to separate Wallonia and Picardy)
- What happens with the Hungarian event chain if Bohemia becomes a democracy?
- Make CBs for war events work so that there's a more elegant solution than reducing infamy
- Teralarga ideas: see Suggestions
- French-speaking POPs appeal to united France to help them with Persia, end up partitioning Persia
- Unequal Treaty events for Nanyue, tweak it for Qin
- Some kind of country/nationalism for Solelha in Florida
- Qin civil war of some kind?
- Dissolution of Maghreb (see suggestions)
- Competition for colonies in SEA, especially between NAP and HIS in the Malay peninsula
- Generic event to annex countries that you have full cores on, as happens with Rome sometimes

Decisions:

- Take a second look at forming Italy and how to do it so that the now-split-off Italian cultures
- Add decision for ZAC to claim Lusatia and Ruthenia
- France takes back Challans (La Roche, 437) from AQT
- Japan claims Ainu Mosir and the northern islands (the latter decision exists already and has merely been disabled)
- AQT decision reclaim SA colonies if they're lost
- Decisions for Roman Empire to conquer Levant, Italy, restore Imperial Borders
	- Move capital back to Rome and assimilate/accept lots
	- Roman Empire can reconquer Rome and get Italian and Sicilian added as accepted, and/or assimilation
	- See the ideas from Crushric - Look in Suggestions.txt
	- Event/decision for, when it has conquered all of Armenia (make this easier?), crack down on Armenians or risk wrath of military?
- Imperial ambitions for Georgia
- Post-revolution Bohemia gets a hold of Syrmia and the Banat
- Owner of Saorvaile in Africa can get Bopolu by event

- Greece rejoins a democratic Roman Empire?
- Portugal claims Atlantic islands
- Update gtfo_HtA with new tags
- check NationalUnification to see if the Arab Union needs to have the relevant culture group excluded in order to be able to form
- A union of Margaria and Vestland
- A GP with power in the area can get Hong Kong somehow if they aren't the one that got Macao

POPs:

- Craftsmen in Europe (which is less industrialised than vanilla)
- Readd Mahayana in China, since all Mahayana were changed to Confucian
- Increase POPs in the super-low-POP countries like SKM, MDT, YKT, KZH, YUC
- Reduce POPs in Vestland, Margaria, Hoyekysten because there aren't a lot of Scandinavians to migrate to these countries
- Orthodox minorities in the Middle East, Armenian heartland, see http://i.imgur.com/7uVsYh4.png
- Adjust POPs in USR - Fewer in the south (as in Brazil today), more in the north around the capital, more Guarani in Paraguay/Brazil
- Remove Andean POPs from the southern part of Inca?
- Boost POPs of Uganda and Rwanda regions which have had their province size increased?
- Add some Turkmen folks (maybe minorities) in Syria
- Change the French in the Holy Land to Outremer or Levantine or whatever
- Add more Jews throughout Europe! (Partly done, maybe needs more)
- Add more minorities in Europe on the other side of borders
- Too many German POPs?

Militaries:
- Navies for much of the world
- Central American countries
- Uilscyr, after POP adjustment

Localisation:
- In general, modify non-HtA events so they fit the world as is.
- Parties for Wallonia, Brabant, lots more
- Finish renaming provinces and regions in Australia, New Zealand
- Rename sea provinces as needed around the world, especially in the New World
- Rewrite Death of Emperor Iesada event to reflect the situation on the ground

Map:
- Trade ports in Japan for Naples, Alba and/or others? Added a small port in v0.31 for Netherlands
- Mess with the Argentinian Andes. Maybe give Lonca more control over them. That way, Argentina doesn't so easily get a crazy snaky shape up into Inca
- Mess with overall region/province shapes in Africa so they're less OTL-y
- Do some province reshaping and add another province in the border region between AQT and NAV
- Make provinces conform better to new RDS rivers. Especially Khiva-Persia
- Make the Oheskewen canal be in its own small province.

Flags: More about this can be found in the "List of small things to be done" on the forum (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-heirs-to-aquit%C3%A0nia-altervicky-mod.895808/page-5#post-20555393)

CB:
- Incorporate /u/sdrasmu4's split conquest CBs? The only trouble is that maybe the AI would be bad at using it and that would mess up balance
- China: Demand Concession CB gives 0 infamy when there are no valid targets
- Increase badboy decay since war is meant to be more widespread?
- Restore monarchy CB?
- Restrict Europeans' CB potentials on NA uncivs
- Punitive expedition mechanic to get trade ports in Qin

Other:
- Go back through eventually and add newspaper entries
- Balance factories, infrastructure, prestige
- Add silk/wine-related industry to PRE
- One day in the future: Incorporate (some of?) PDM. I want spices right now, but maybe in the future when I have a better computer that can handle it, I'll maybe incorporate it for a bit more variety and closer realism
	- Spices for Indonesia would be nice anyways
- Nerf nationalist/pan-nationalist rebels somehow - Especially German pan-nationalists
