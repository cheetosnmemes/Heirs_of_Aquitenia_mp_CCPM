	them back by starring a make puppet war

If a decision is made to ban slavery in-game, then there should also be a series of apartheid events that increase militancy,

Red Clydeside events
(A)Colombian Civil war 
(A)Revolution of the park in Argentina
(A) communist 5 year plans
	industry, literacy, infra(RGO modernization), technology, military, party loyalty
	I figure industry should be a global promotion of laborers with a negative pop growth as well as some factory throughput bonuses.
	Education should be a clergy promotion rate increase, clerk rate increase and a buff to education efficiency but I can't figure out a downside for this one.
	Infrastructure will deal with RGO efficiency and I'll see if I can make it reduce the costs of railroads, again I can't think of a specific downside for this one.
	Technology is pretty straight forward, an increase in tech rate, maybe with an increased pop awareness?
	military a blanket slight increases in bonuses as well as soldier and officer promotion chance with a militancy and consciousness growth with the negative being in military and industry tech growth, negative education efficiency and slight pop growth drop?
	party loyalty plan that allows events to fire that make people more communist while purging the reactionaries.
	Maybe it makes a state 20% more communist but kills 10% of all the reactionaries, fascists and anarcho-liberals, and increases their CON and MIL.
	
Flesh out the Soviet factions and parties to better simulate the in-fighting at the time. (please someone else do this I don't have the autism)
Hungarian Aster Revolution of 1918.
Tsar of all slavs(Slavic irredentism?)
Reclaiming Crimea for ottomans
Decision for great powers who have Greece in their sphere to encourage them to attack Turkey for the Coast of Anatolia.

Other things:

Want to help mod? Pick something from the backburner planned list,
make events/decisions/localisation files/whatever for it, put it all into a neat little archive,
and post it on the thread with the word MiniMod somewhere in your post.
If your additions aren't a 'complete pile' of shit (I'll fix most bugs, if there are any),
expect them in the next release! If you want attributation, just say under what name you want your changes attributed to.
If you don't have a preferred name, I'll just name you [whateveryoudid]Bro.


Credits and legal shit:
FinnBro (amongst many aliases that the creator uses) created this minimod for the GSG community.
The only true tripcode you will ever see FinnBro use is FinnBro!!UIw63MjXv78.
If you see a different tripcode without a major announcement and transition period, it is an impostor.
If he ever uses this trip regularly and outside of release posts, then put him out of his misery for the good of the world. 
Hisuibro is currently updating minimod now, I'll do my best!
I wont use a tripcode ever if I'm lucky, you can find me posting Hisui images or space marine cups, although other people like to post the space marine cups
Also, thank you anons, you guys provide ideas, localization and mountains of research help. Love you guys.

Thank you to Rylock and his fine people for making NNM so I can bust my ass making my mod compatible with it. I hope they don't get mad.
Full NNM credits are found here: http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?592320-New-Nations-Mod-(For-AHD)

A big thank you to Napoops (the guy making the Napoleon's Legacy mod for /gsg/) for the Lucky Nations decisions as well as a few other bits of errata.

Personal modifications are accepted and encouraged (it'll make you learn something about modding, which is always good),
just don't redistribute your version of the mod without properly attributing me.
If you go full Ubik and try to make a profit off this, I'm going to laugh in your face.
I don't give a shit if you do or don't try to fork this into a major mod,
just don't claim this work entirely as your own. Give credit where credit is due, bro.

If you find this mod on the Paradox Forums, inform me immediately. This mod was never meant to be on the Paradox Forums, nor will I ever put it there because finnbro said the forums are bad.

Reasonable suggestions, balancing issues, bug reports, etc are appreciated and welcomed. Just post on /gsg/ and I'll respond to you.
If you don't know where /gsg/ is, don't worry yourself about it. Just know that the target audience is not you.
