# Some really good git console commands : 

```sh
cd "a folder"/ #you go to the folder, only if he is under the current one



cd ../ #you go to the folder above the one you're in



ls #will show you all the folder and files under the current one



pwd #will show you the path to the current folder



git add "filename" #will add the file to your local repository to next upload it



git commit -m"commentary" #will register the added file and get them ready to upload, -m is for the commentary, no commit without commentary



git push "remote name" #will push the commited files to the remote you selected, it will upload them



git pull "remote name" #will pull the files of the remote you selected to your loacl git foler, so it will download them



#the up arrow will give you the ability to look for commands you typed in your git console



#when you write a folder or name file, if you press tab it will try to auto-complete the name. So if it doesn't it's either that 2 files got a really close name or the file/folder you're looking for just don't exist under your current folder
```


That's it !
