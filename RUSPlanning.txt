- Intervene on behalf of Anatole in civil war?
- Make it so that Ukraine isn't a country but there's something else
- Why can't it just  attack Russia immediately? Allies? Power of the church in favour of Russia?
- SML has precarious peace with the nomads like cossack, kazakh (and someone else?), which makes them less powerful than they appear

RUS
- Event/decision to sphere Kazakh Khanate and Cossack Hetmanate
- Puppet Kazakh
- After Smolensk is no longer a threat, some chain to either annex Kazakh peacefully or go to war with Kazakh
- Continue south into C. Asia - conflict with Persia
